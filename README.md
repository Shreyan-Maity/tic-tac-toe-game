[Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://shreyan-maity.github.io/tic-tac-toe-game/tic-tac-toe.html)

This is a complete, single-file web application for a modern and visually appealing Tic-Tac-Toe game.

It is built with plain HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic. The entire game is contained in the index.html file (originally tic-tac-toe.html), making it extremely portable and easy to run.

âœ¨ Key Features

Modern "Glassmorphism" UI: The game board and cells have a semi-transparent, blurred background effect.

Animated Gameplay:

'X's and 'O's animate with a subtle "pop" when placed.

The restart button has a smooth hover and scale effect.

Visual Win Indication: When a player wins, an animated line is drawn directly through the three winning squares.

Responsive Design: The game board scales gracefully for both desktop and mobile screens.

Single-File Application: All code (HTML, CSS, JS) is in one file. No build steps or dependencies are needed.
